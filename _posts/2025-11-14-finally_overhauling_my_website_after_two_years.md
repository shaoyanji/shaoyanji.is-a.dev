title: Finally overhauling my website after two years

I was doing some benchmarking on my website and two consecutive results ended up with time to load at 2 minutes. I'm not sure if this is something to do with Cloudflare getting DDoSed but I'm going with a much lighter-weight approach with 14kb max.

There is a build trick that I would like to perform as I have been experimenting with a few. Iframes, htmx, nix as a site builder and a bit of javascript to pull json from a public googlesheet.

Should there be an html page that can be easily greppable and navigable through iframes on te terminal with htmlq and parsing tricks with nushell? We shall find out.
